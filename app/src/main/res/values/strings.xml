    <string name="ligo_info_text">The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is designed to open the field of
 gravitational-wave astrophysics through the direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by
 Einstein\’s General Theory of Relativity. LIGO\’s multi-kilometer-scale gravitational wave detectors
 use laser interferometry to measure the minute ripples in space-time caused by passing
 gravitational waves from cataclysmic cosmic sources such as the mergers of pairs of neutron
 stars or black holes, or by supernovae. LIGO consists of two widely separated interferometers
 within the United States—one in Hanford, Washington and the other in Livingston,
 Louisiana—operated in unison to detect gravitational waves.</string>

    <string name="grav_wave_theory">According to newtonian theory, gravitational effects propagate from place to place instantaneously. With the
    advent of Einstein\'s special theory of relativity in 1905, a theory uniting the concepts of space and time into that
    of four dimensional flat space-time.</string>

    <string name="ligo_facts_text">Gravitational Waves Are Ripples in Space-Time
    According to Albert Einstein\’s theory of general relativity, gravity is not a force reaching out through the universe. It\’s a bending
    of space-time. When an object accelerates, it distorts the space-time around it, and that distortion travels away from the source
    at the speed of light.

    Gravitational Waves Come from Really Heavy Objects
    So how massive an object are we talking about? The first proof that gravitational waves actually exist came from a binary
    pulsar—two neutron stars, each about the mass of the Sun, that orbit each other. The pulsars\’ orbit is gradually shrinking,
    so the pulsars are losing energy. That energy is exactly the amount that general relativity predicts that the pulsars would give
    off in gravitational waves.

    The Effect of Gravitational Waves Is Very, Very Small
    Since gravitational waves are a ripple in space-time, they cause the distance between two points to change ever so slightly. How
    slightly? LIGO must be able to measure distances as small as 10−19 meter. The proton has a radius of about 0.85 × 10−15 meter,
    or 10,000 times larger.

    Measuring Gravitational Waves Is Tricky
    To detect a change in distance much smaller than the proton requires great precision. Each LIGO installation is a laser
    interferometer made up of two underground pipes, each 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) wide and 4 km (2.5 miles) long, set in an L-shape.
    The inside of the pipes is a vacuum. When a gravitational wave passes through LIGO, one arm of the instrument gets longer and
    the other gets shorter. A laser beam is split in half, sent down the two pipes, reflected back, and then recombined so the two
    beams cancel each other out in destructive interference if there is no gravitational wave. If there is a gravitational wave, the beams
    won\’t cancel each other out. A 4-km long beam is still not enough to detect a gravitational wave, so the beams are bounced back
    and forth about 400 times so the light travels a distance of 1,600 km (1,000 miles).</string>
